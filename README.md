### Step 3: Create a branch

- A branch is a way to keep your changes separate from the main part of the project called `Master`. For example if things go wrong and you are not happy with your changes 

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:you can simply delete the branch and the main project won't be affected.

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

`cd IOSD_MAIT_Hacktoberfest-2020_WebDev`

`git checkout -b <your-name-profile-card>`

(While the branch name can be anything we suggest you to keep it the way we mentioned.)

### Step 4: Make necessary changes and commit

1. Open the project in _Brackets_ or
   _VS Code_. Make sure you are not on _master_ branch.

6. Modify the code while working on the issue. If you execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

7. Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

`git add .`

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

`git commit -m "<your-name> message"`

### Step 5: Push Changes

Push your changes using the command `git push origin <your-branch-name>`

### Step 6: Make a Pull Request
