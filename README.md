# Hacktoberfest-2020

- A repository based on HTML CSS JS framework made for the Web developers to contribute in this project as a part of Hactoberfest 2020.
- In this repository, each contributor will be working on the issue and get hands on experience with creating PRs and learn about branching, merging, etc.


# Go through the  `CONTRIBUTING.md`  file  to get to know about how and what may you contribute in this project.

## Steps for your contribution:

### Step 1: Fork this repository

- A fork would place a copy of this project in your GitHub Account

### Step 2: Clone the repository

- Cloning the repository will place a local copy of project on your own machine
- Copy the URL from the copy to clipboard icon


- Open a terminal and run the following git command :

`git clone https://github.com/IOSD/IOSD_MAIT_Hacktoberfest-2020_WebDev.git`

### Step 3: Create a branch

- A branch is a way to keep your changes separate from the main part of the project called `Master`. For example if things go wrong and you are not happy with your changes 

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:you can simply delete the branch and the main project won't be affected.

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

`cd IOSD_MAIT_Hacktoberfest-2020_WebDev`

`git checkout -b <your-name-profile-card>`

(While the branch name can be anything we suggest you to keep it the way we mentioned.)

### Step 4: Make necessary changes and commit

1. Open the project in _Brackets_ or
   _VS Code_. Make sure you are not on _master_ branch.

6. Modify the code while working on the issue. If you execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

7. Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

`git add .`

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

`git commit -m "<your-name> message"`

### Step 5: Push Changes

Push your changes using the command `git push origin <your-branch-name>`

### Step 6: Make a Pull Request

Go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on it.


Now submit the pull request


Congrats! You have made your first contribution! Happy Coding!
